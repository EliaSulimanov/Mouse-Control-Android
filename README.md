## About
This project is made to control your pc mouse using your smartphone.  
I got this idea since I searched one like this but all I found was not user-friendly and not easy to setup.  
This is the client side app.  
The user side app is running on the smartphone you want to use as mouse.  

## How it works
 - At startup the APP is asking the user for key (generated by the [server](https://github.com/EliaSulimanov/mouse_control_PC)).
 - After the user inserting the key given by the server, the mousepad will show up.
 - Every click on the mousepad will be detected and sent to the server.
 - The server will move the mouse.
 
## Quick start
### Using
All you need to do is compile and install the APK.  
You are good to go!
